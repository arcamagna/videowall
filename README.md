### Files
Directory name or list of videos/images. If omitted current directory is used.

### Operation
If there aren't enough files available or the number of files is limited with -m then they will be repeated to fill the given area.
Performance can be very slow for larger values of n especially when mode is L or P or tag is used for title.
Lossless or ProRes encoding can produce very large files. These have very little or no compression and are best used with a set duration.
Encoding parameters can be modified in the config file if needed.

### Examples
```
videowall
```
Produces a 4x4 grid of videos and/or images from the current directory. Sequence will be repeated if there aren't 16 unique valid files.
```
videowall -pSn2 -g"#054da5 4" -T centre
```
Produces a 8x2 random ordered grid of videos each having a 4 px blue frame and title tag bottom centre if one exists.
```
videowall -rs -n6 -f "mp4 mkv" -o 50 -R "/tmp/6x6 video wall.mp4" ~
```
Produces a 6x6 grid by recursively searching for mp4 and mkv files in user directory. The first 50 files will be skipped. Files will not be checked for valid video streams. Output will be recorded to "/tmp/6x6 video wall.mp4" instead of displaying on screen.
